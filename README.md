## The Problem

Every personal finance app gets it wrong. They obsess over categorizing every $4.50 coffee transaction, building pie charts of your spending categories, and sending you alerts like "you spent 23% more on dining this month."

Nobody asked for that.

The real problem is simple:

- **How much cash do I actually have right now?**
- **What's due in the next 2 weeks?**
- **Am I going to be short anywhere?**
- **Where should I move money to avoid fees, interest, and late charges?**

That's it. That's the whole product.

## The Solution

One screen. Three answers.

### 1. Cash Position
Total liquid cash across all your accounts. One number at the top.

### 2. Upcoming Outflows
Every bill, credit card payment, and subscription due in the next 30 days. No surprises.

### 3. The Move
AI tells you exactly what to do: "Move $2,400 from savings → checking before Friday to cover your Chase bill. You'll have $1,200 buffer left for rent on the 1st."

## What CashBase Is NOT

- ❌ Transaction categorization
- ❌ Budgeting spreadsheets
- ❌ Spending pie charts
- ❌ "You spent more on dining" alerts
- ❌ Subscription tracker

We don't care what you spent money on. We care that your money is in the right place at the right time.

## Mission

Kill the complexity in personal finance. People don't need another app that tracks every dollar — they need one that tells them where to move money and when.

## Vision

A world where nobody pays a late fee, overdraft fee, or interest charge because their money was in the wrong account at the wrong time.

## How It Works

- **Plaid** for account aggregation (balances, liabilities, recurring transactions, investments)
- **AI layer** for cash flow optimization and transfer recommendations
- **Mobile-first** — this is a glance-and-go tool, not a sit-down-and-budget tool

### Supported Integrations (via Plaid)
- Banks (Chase, etc.)
- Brokerages (Morgan Stanley, Robinhood, etc.)
